## Question 1.7.1
1. What does isothermal mean? Identify all the isothermal layers of the atmosphere.

Isothermal = Regions of equal temperature.

The isothermal layers are the tropopause, stratopause, and mesopause.

## Question 1.7.2
2. What is an inversion? Identify all the inversion layers of the atmosphere.

The temperature normally decreases when going up in height. An inversion is a region where the temperature actually *increases* with height.

The inversion layers of the atmosphere are the stratosphere and the thermosphere.

## Question 1.7.3
3. Why is the stratosphere warmer than the troposphere?

The ozone in the stratosphere absorbs large amounts of UV radiation. More energy means higher temperatures.

## Question 1.7.4
4. If you jump in a hot air balloon when the surface air temperature is $$25^\circ C (77^\circ F)$$, what would be the temperature at an altitude of 3 km (about 10,000 ft)? Assume we have an average lapse rate.

The average lapse rate is $$6.5^\circ C/km$$. So rising 1 km, the temperature drops $$6.5\circ C$$. Rising 2 km, the temperature drops another 6.5, so a total drop of $$2*6.5\circ C = 13.0\circ C$. Rising 3 km, the temperature drops another 6.5, so a total drop of $$3*6.5\circ C = 19.5\circ C$$.

$$25^\circ C - 19.5\circ C = 5.5^\circ C$$

A shortcut: $$6.5\tfrac{^\circ C}{km}\cdot 3~km = 19.5^\circ C$$. Then $$25^\circ C - 19.5\circ C = 5.5^\circ C$$.

If you want to do this in Fahrenheit and feet, the average lapse rate is $$3.5^\circ F/1,000~ft$$.

$$\frac{3.5^\circ F}{1,000~ft}\cdot 10,000~ft = 35^\circ F$$

The temperature then drops to $$77^\circ F - 35^\circ F = 42^\circ F$$.
