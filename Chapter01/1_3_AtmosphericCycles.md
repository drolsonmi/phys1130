__Sources__: Methods that add a compound to the atmosphere

__Sinks__: Methods that remove a compound from the atmosphere

Total amount depends on the balance between sources and sinks:
* If the __sources produce more__ than the sinks can remove, then the total amount __increases__
* If the __sources produce less__ than the sinks can remove, then the total amount __decreases__
* If the __sources and sinks are balanced__, then the total amount __remains the same__

# Review Questions
1. On a particular day, carbon dioxide is produced in a small city with these major sources:
* respiration (produces 50,000 kg in a day)
* running cars (produces 246,000 kg a day)
* generation of electricity (produces 150,000 kg a day)

This is offset by three major sinks:
* photosynthesis of a nearby forest (absorbs 109,500 kg a day)
* marine life in a nearby lake (absorbs 7,500 kg a day)
* microbs in soil (absorbs 35,400 kg a day)

Will there be an overall increase or decrease in carbon dioxide on this day?

## Question 1.3.1
1. On a particular day, carbon dioxide is produced in a small city with these major sources:
* respiration (produces 50,000 kg in a day)
* running cars (produces 246,000 kg a day)
* generation of electricity (produces 150,000 kg a day)

This is offset by three major sinks:
* photosynthesis of a nearby forest (absorbs 109,500 kg a day)
* marine life in a nearby lake (absorbs 7,500 kg a day)
* microbs in soil (absorbs 35,400 kg a day)

The total produced by sources is 50,000 kg + 246,000 kg + 150,000 kg = 293,600 kg.

The total absorbed by sinks is 109,500 kg + 7,500 kg + 35,400 kg = 152,400 kg

Since there is more carbon dioxide produced, __the carbon dioxide levels will increase during this day__.
