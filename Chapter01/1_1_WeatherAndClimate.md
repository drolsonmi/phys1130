__Weather__: Statements of what is/was happening in our atmosphere *at a specific time or place*
* It is hot outside.
* The wind was very strong last night.
* The snow was 7 inches deep on January 11 last year.

__Climate__: Statements of what is/was happening in our atmosphere *over a range of time* or *over a larger area*
* Summer is generally hot
* We had 7.6 inches of rain throughout last year
* We are currently in a dry spell
* Our record high temperature is 108*F

Climate statements are general statements, and may not indicate what is happening at a specific time.
* "In Florida, summer rainstorms generally come at 3:00pm."
* This is a climate statement and isn't a guarantee that it will rain at 3:00pm today.

## Question 1.1.1
1. "Over the past century, global average temperatures have increased due to climate change."

We are talking about temperatures both over a large area and over a large period of time. Therefore, __this is a statement of climate__.

<div popover id="Question_2">

## Question 1.1.2
2. "It rained heavily in Denver yesterday afternoon."

## Question 1.1.3
3. "Yesterday's high temperature at Snow College was 97*F, the hottest of the month so far."

This is actually both.
* "Yesterday's high temperature at Snow College was 97*F" indicates a specific time (yesterday) and a specific place (Snow College). So, this is a statement of weather.
* "...the hottest of the month so far" compares the weather statement just made to all temperatures over a large period of time (the month). So, this is a statement of climate.

So, this sentence has __one element that is about weather__ and __another element that is about climate__.
