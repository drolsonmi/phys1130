$$Weight=mass*(acceleration~of~gravity)=m\cdot 9.8 \qquad Pressure=\frac{Weight}{Area}$$

__Example__:

A large box has a mass of 2,300 *kg*. The bottom face of the box has an area of 3.4 $$m^3$$. What is the pressure it exerts on the bed of a truck?
* $$Weight = m\cdot 9.8 = 2300~kg\cdot 9.8 = 22,540~N$$
* $$Pressure = \frac{Weight}{Area} = \frac{22,540~N}{3.4~m^3} = 6,629~Pa$$ (Pascals)

# Review Questions
1. What is the pressure on the feet of a person with a mass of 90 *kg* and a total surface area on the feet of 0.062 $$m^2$$ (that's 96.1 $$in^2$$)?
    * After solving on your own, check the <button popovertarget="Question_1">Solution</button>
2. In the example problem earlier, we saw a shipping box exerts a pressure of 6,629 *Pa*. What is this pressure in *psi*? What is this pressure in *mb*?

3. Atmospheric pressure is 101,325 *Pa*. The Earth has a surface area of 196.9 million $$mi^2$$ ($$1~mi^2 = 2,590,000~m^2$$). What is the weight of the atmosphere?

## Question 1.6.1
1. What is the pressure on the feet of a person with a mass of 90 *kg* and a total surface area on the feet of 0.062 $$m^2$$?

$$Weight = m\cdot 9.8 = 90~kg\cdot 9.8 = 882~N$$

$$Pressure = \frac{Weight}{Area} = \frac{882~N}{0.062~m^2} = 14,226~Pa$$

## Question 1.6.2
2. In the example problem earlier, we saw a shipping box exerts a pressure of 6,629 *Pa*. What is this pressure in *psi*? What is this pressure in *mb*?

To convert units:
1. Find an equality between current and desired units
2. Multiply current number by the part of equality with desired unit, divide by other part with current unit

$$6,629~Pa\cdot\frac{14.7~psi}{101,325~Pa} = 6,629\frac{14.7~psi}{101,325} = 0.962~psi$$

So that is a weight of 0.962 pounds (lbs) by every square inch of the shipping box.

$$6,629~Pa\cdot\frac{1013.25~mb}{101,325~Pa} = 66.29~mb$$

## Question 1.6.3
3. Atmospheric pressure is 101,325 *Pa*. The Earth has a surface area of 196.9 million $$mi^2$$ ($$1~mi^2 = 2,590,000~m^2$$). What is the weight of the atmosphere?

$$Area = 196,900,000~mi^2\cdot\frac{2,590,000~m^2}{1~mi^2} = 510,000,000,000,000~m^2$$

$$Pressure = \frac{Weight}{Area} \qquad\to\qquad Weight = Pressure\cdot Area$$

$$Pressure = 101,325~Pa \cdot 510,000,000,000,000~m^2 = 51,700,000,000,000,000,000~N$$

(Your calculator likely says 5.17E19. That is 5.17 * 10,000,000,000,000,000,000 (that's 19 0's).)

That is 51.7 quintillion Newtons, or 11.24 quintillion pounds, or 5.62 quadrillion tons! Our atmosphere is really heavy!
