## Question 1.2.1
1. What gas is most abundant in our atmosphere?

The most stable gas in our atmosphere is $$N_2$$, nitrogen gas. Because it is so stable, it isn't removed much from the atmosphere and has accumulated for millions of years. So, __nitrogen gas is the most abundant gas in our atmosphere__.

## Question 1.2.2
2. What gas has the most variability in our atmosphere?

There are many gases with a lot of variability, most notably water vapor and carbon dioxide.
* Water vapor varies between 0% and 4% of the total atmosphere
* Carbon dioxide also varies a lot, but varies around 0.04% of the total atmosphere

So, __water vapor is the gas with the most variability in our atmosphere__.

## Question 1.2.3
3. How did water end up in our atmosphere?

Water vapor entered our atmosphere through the process of __outgassing__ where pockets of gas under the Earth's crust leak through vents in the crust.
